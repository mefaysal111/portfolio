        <h3>Senior Investigation Specialist</h3>
        <span>Amazon development centre-India • Dec 2022 – Present</span>
        <p>
           At Amazon, I worked as a Senior Investigation Specialist, where I handled complex, high-risk investigations to identify irregular account activity and mitigate fraud. My role involved reviewing large volumes of transaction and account data to detect suspicious patterns, determine root causes, and recommend long-term preventive solutions. I consistently managed over 40 investigations per day while maintaining accuracy and adherence to quality standards, even during high-pressure peak periods.
</p>
<p>I played a key role in improving operational efficiency by creating and maintaining dashboards to monitor workflows and performance metrics. I also contributed to risk reduction by establishing and refining standard operating procedures (SOPs) that minimized exposure without compromising investigation quality. In addition, I resolved escalated cases, communicated investigation outcomes to customers via email, and delivered a high standard of customer service while addressing sensitive account concerns.
</p>
<p>Beyond individual case handling, I actively supported team growth and quality assurance. I mentored newly onboarded investigators by providing training, workflow guidance, and best practices to improve productivity and accuracy. I conducted investigation audits to identify errors and ensure compliance, and spearheaded a targeted review of investigation processes, identifying bottlenecks and implementing revised SOPs that significantly improved team efficiency and overall performance.
